# How to monitor cluster events

RDS Cluster, Instance and Cluster Snapshot events can be used to identify key changes that have occurred. This can be particularly useful in a failover situation.  


The default window of recent events displayed is rather short. You can view up to 14 days of events.
An easy example is to look at all events since the creation of the resource, in this example the cluster.

    CREATED=$(aws rds describe-db-clusters --db-cluster-identifier ${CLUSTER_ID} --query '*[].ClusterCreateTime' --output text)
    aws rds describe-events --source-type db-cluster --source-identifier ${CLUSTER_ID} --start-time ${CREATED}
    {
        "Events": [
            {
                "EventCategories": [
                    "creation"
                ],
                "SourceType": "db-cluster",
                "SourceArn": "arn:aws:rds:us-east-2:999999999999:cluster:rds-aurora-mysql-demo",
                "Date": "2021-12-14T20:13:32.411Z",
                "Message": "DB cluster created",
                "SourceIdentifier": "rds-aurora-mysql-demo"
            }
        }
    }

## Upgrade events

In this example of a minor version upgrade, you can see a cluster and an instance event.

    aws rds describe-events --source-type db-cluster --source-identifier ${CLUSTER_ID}
    {
        "Events": [
            {
                "EventCategories": [
                    "maintenance"
                ],
                "SourceType": "db-cluster",
                "SourceArn": "arn:aws:rds:us-east-2:414340713341:cluster:rds-aurora-mysql-demo",
                "Date": "2021-12-14T21:04:22.856Z",
                "Message": "Database cluster has been patched",
                "SourceIdentifier": "rds-aurora-mysql-demo"
            }
        ]
    }


    aws rds describe-events --source-type db-instance --source-identifier ${INSTANCE_ID}
    {
        "Events": [
            {
                "EventCategories": [],
                "SourceType": "db-instance",
                "SourceArn": "arn:aws:rds:us-east-2:414340713341:db:rds-aurora-mysql-demo-0",
                "Date": "2021-12-14T21:01:24.716Z",
                "Message": "Attempting to upgrade the database with zero downtime.",
                "SourceIdentifier": "rds-aurora-mysql-demo-0"
            },
            {
                "EventCategories": [],
                "SourceType": "db-instance",
                "SourceArn": "arn:aws:rds:us-east-2:414340713341:db:rds-aurora-mysql-demo-0",
                "Date": "2021-12-14T21:01:24.717Z",
                "Message": "Attempt to upgrade the database with zero downtime finished. The process took 0 ms, 4 connections preserved, 0 connections dropped. See the database error log for details.",
                "SourceIdentifier": "rds-aurora-mysql-demo-0"
            }
        ]
    }
